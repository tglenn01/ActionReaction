**Action Reaction**
## A subtitle
**Reaction Time Dual Adventure**

A *bulleted* list:
- My application is a reaction based adventure game where you fight in duals against computer opponents while enjoying
a heart pulling story.
- This application is for people who are looking to feel the **thrill** of being rewarded for their **intense** focus
 for an **emotional payoff**
- I've always wanted to make a game that *connected* with me and this is my first oppurtinity to be able to express some
 creative liberties and create something I personally find fun and hope other can too.

USER'S STORY (phase one):
- As a user, I want to be able to be prompted to draw my weapon when I should react.
- As a user, I want to be able to know whether I won the dual or not.
- As a user, I want to be able to add my times to a high score list.
- As a user, I want the game to select a difficulty and have harder duals to win.
