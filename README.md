## A subtitle
**Reaction Time Dual Adventure**

A *bulleted* list:
- My application is a reaction based adventure game where you fight in duals against computer opponents while enjoying
a heart pulling story.
- This application is for people who are looking to feel the **thrill** of being rewarded for their **intense** focus
 for an **emotional payoff**
- I've always wanted to make a game that *connected* with me and this is my first oppurtinity to be able to express some
 creative liberties and create something I personally find fun and hope other can too.

USER'S STORY (phase one):
- As a user, I want to be able to be prompted to draw my weapon when I should react.
- As a user, I want to be able to know whether I won the dual or not.
- As a user, I want to be able to add my times to a high score list.
- As a user, I want the game to select a difficulty and have harder duals to win.
(Phase two)
- As a user, I want to be able to save my list of high scores
- As a user, I want to be able to start the game with the same high scores with which I saved

Uses of the Program (for TA)
- The main point is to able able to test you reaction time and see a general improvement or if you are slipping
- Start by running main and then selecting your difficulty from 1 to 5, 5 being the hardest
- After hitting the button declaring you are ready the button will disappear until you are prompted to fire your weapon
- You will be shown your time after each dual and you can see all your high scores in the high scores tab
- Feel free to save your data as well and it will be stored in the highScores.txt file in the data package
Notes about reading the code: 
- All GUI elements have been abstracted to be within default Layout as to be able to change
small details without having to sort through the whole code
- the css style sheet is with the default layouts as they all are set to that style
Requirements for the stage:
- First event related to HighScoreList) if you press a key (enter) fast enough in the game you store a new high score
- Second event related to HighScoreList) You can click a button to view all your high scores in order from fast to slow
- Audio Component) Along with the Fire! prompt the game will play a noise telling you when to fire your weapon
- Save Component) You can click the save button on the main screen to save all the high scores and they load when you
restart the application every time.
Postscript:
- If you wanna try and win on the hardest difficulty it requires .2 second reaction time! Good luck!
