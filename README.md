**Distraught Heart**
## A subtitle
**Reaction Time Dual Adventure**

A *bulleted* list:
- My application is a reaction based adventure game where you fight in duals against computer opponents while enjoying
a heart pulling story.
- This application is for people who are looking to feel the **thrill** of being rewarded for their **intense** focus
 for an **emotional payoff**
- I've always wanted to make a game that *connected* with me and this is my first oppurtinity to be able to express some
 creative liberties and create something I personally find fun and hope other can too.

An example of text with **bold** and *italic* fonts.  Note that the IntelliJ markdown previewer doesn't seem to render 
the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.
